# Cyclistic_Bike_Share_Analysis
## Google Data Analytics Capstone


The Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study involves following the data analysis process to answer business questions.


## Overview
Cyclistic operates a bike-share program with over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations, offering various options including reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes to cater to riders with disabilities. While most riders choose traditional bikes, approximately 8% utilize assistive options. The service is popular for leisure rides, with around 30% of users using the bikes for daily commuting.


## Business task
1. Conduct a comparative analysis to identify key usage patterns and behaviors between annual members and casual riders of Cyclistic bikes, highlighting differences in frequency, duration, routes, and preferences.
2. Investigate the motivations and incentives driving casual riders to purchase Cyclistic annual memberships, focusing on factors such as cost-effectiveness, convenience, benefits, and overall value proposition.
3. Formulate a strategic plan leveraging digital media channels to effectively target casual riders and encourage them to transition into becoming Cyclistic annual members, emphasizing personalized messaging, targeted promotions, and engagement strategies tailored to their needs and preferences.
